Video Annotation Tools for Action Localization

This file is primarily a to-do list for the development. We wil fill in the actual readme later

* Resolve old dependencies
* Remove the dependency on pyvision (vision functions) and turkic (for MT). We will use python-opencv for vision functions. 
* Create a separate interface for naming the actions
* Proper documentation and tests
